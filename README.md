# Loan-Prediction-Bank-of-Baroda-Finathon
 When we look around us and see Global Warming, it isn’t a prediction, it’s a
happening” but when we again look around and see Banks so efficiently financing
loans it’s a prediction.

Banks are the credit creators, thus it is very important that they make the best out of
technology to assist them in their routine functions. The Financial Institutions have
data related to the customer which has the complete customer history. If this data is
put to good use, it can bring out intelligent results. In our case, it will assist the bank
in decision making as if the system is an analyst itself. Bank has many decisions to
make one of them is to decide whether the debtor would be a defaulter or not. If he
comes out to be the former it’s not a favourable situation.

We thus propose a Loan Financing Prediction Model which will help the bank in
making correct decisions regarding financing loans for its customers.
